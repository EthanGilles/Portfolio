## About the Project

This website is my personal portfolio, where I present my completed projects, highlight my technical skills, and share information about myself. The goal was to build a modern and responsive web application that reflects my technical knowledge and personal style.

I used this project to learn the **React** framework and to experiment with different UI/UX tools and libraries. It was a great opportunity to hone my skills in front-end development and deployment practices.

## Features

- Responsive design for seamless viewing across devices
- Smooth animations and transitions using **Framer Motion**
- Carousel and interactive components using **Slick** library
- Clean and customizable styling with **Tailwind CSS**
- Fast and reliable deployment using **Vercel**

## Design Process

I loosely designed the website using **Figma**, where I planned out the layout and overall visual flow of the site. Figma helped me organize my ideas and structure the website’s layout before development. I also created a custom logo for the website, which I edited in **Pixlr**.

## Technologies Used

Here are the key technologies and libraries I used to develop this project:

- **React**: The JavaScript framework used to build the interactive components and manage the state of the application.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding animations and transitions to different elements on the page.
- **Slick Carousel**: To create the image and project sliders on the site.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the entire website, allowing for rapid customization and clean design.
- **Pixlr**: For photo editing, including creating and editing the custom logo.
- **Vercel**: Used for seamless deployment and hosting of the website.
  
## Setup and Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-website
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```

Your site should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

The site contains different components such as:

- **Home**: An introduction to who I am.
- **Projects**: A showcase of some of the projects I’ve worked on, with details on each.
- **Technologies**: A summary of my technical skills and proficiencies.
- **Contact**: Information to get in touch with me directly or through social links.
