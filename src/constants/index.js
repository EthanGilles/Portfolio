export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hi! I'm Ethan. I'm a Senior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern Maine. I have a deep interest in tech, especially in IT, DevOps and Automation. My coursework has given me with experience in building projects using languages like Python and Java, and in my free time I enjoy working with different front-end frameworks and scripting. Professionally, I have experience in IT with automation, completing a project to automate updates using PowerShell and Ansible during my last summer internship. I'm excited to be starting my career in the tech industry and look forward to learning more!`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Outside of technology, I have a wide range of interests that keep me balanced and engaged. I enjoy traveling, skiing, reading, hiking, biking, live music, and disc golf. I also enjoy building things, playing video games, and tending to my collection of house plants. Spending quality time with family, friends, my girlfriend Althea, and my cat Olive is something I deeply value. Prior to beginning my Computer Science undergraduate studies, I spent a transformative year traveling across the continental U.S. in a van, which gave me the opportunity to explore diverse landscapes and meet new people.

My journey into technology began with a deep curiosity about how computers work, but over time, I discovered that I truly love the process of learning itself. Iâ€™m constantly seeking out new challenges and enjoy applying my knowledge to small projects, which allow me to explore new concepts while also helping others. This combination of curiosity and the desire to build practical solutions keeps me motivated in my studies and work.`;
